    "text": "2.¬†¬†¬†Understanding and Defining Success\nSuccess in drug development is complex, partly because it often spans multiple disciplines such as clinical, regulatory, operational, and commercial, and partly because the concept of success evolves as a drug moves through the development process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nStress to your audience that ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is multifaceted. Use an analogy: explain that a clinician might define success by patient improvement, a regulator by the availability of sufficient evidence for approval, and commercial teams by market viability. Frame your role as helping to quantify and integrate these diverse success factors into a cohesive PoS assessment.\n\n\nTraditionally, statisticians focused on ensuring robust design for regulatory studies by utilizing statistical techniques to design an appropriately powered study to detect a meaningful effect supporting regulatory approval.\nMore recently, there has been greater focus on interim analyses, decision rules, and strategic-level involvement considering entire development programs with interconnected decision points and success criteria.\nStatisticians are increasingly involved at a strategic level, extending beyond individual clinical trials by considering the entire development program with different decision points and success criteria required at each step. By considering how these criteria and decisions depend on each other, statisticians play a crucial role in supporting a project or development team to define, quantify, and maximize success.\n\nDifferent Types of Success\nDifferent stakeholders will have different ideas of what success might entail. To ensure alignment among stakeholders, it is essential to define success criteria clearly. These criteria may vary depending on the perspective of different stakeholders, such as clinical teams, regulatory bodies and investors. Key success criteria include:\nClinical Success\n\nEfficacy: Demonstrating a meaningful therapeutic effect, including both statistical significance and clinically relevant benefit\nSafety: Ensuring an acceptable benefit-risk profile\n\nRegulatory Success\n\nApproval Readiness: Meeting the requirements of regulatory agencies, including alignment with expectations for efficacy and safety\n\nOperational Success\nClinical Operations: Achieving timely recruitment and data availability for interim or final analyses, especially when strategic or competitive timelines are involved\nManufacturing: Ensuring the drug can be produced to specification\nMarket Success\n\nMarket Potential: Aligning with a Target Product Profile (TPP) that supports sales targets and market share\nPayer Value: Demonstrating clinical and economic value that supports payer expectations and reimbursement strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nExplain these key criteria as a checklist. Emphasize that overall program success often requires ticking multiple boxes, not just achieving statistical significance on one endpoint.\n\n\nThese success criteria should be combined in a stepwise fashion, for example:\nPhase 3 study success (Efficacy √ó Safety): Obtaining statistically significant and clinically relevant results that support the drug effectiveness in one or multiple studies, with a proportionate and acceptable safety profile in the context of the drug therapeutic benefits.\nRegulatory success (Efficacy √ó Safety √ó Regulatory): Meeting phase 3 study success criteria and having drug approved by target regulatory agencies.\nMarket Success (Efficacy √ó Safety √ó Regulatory √ó Market): Regulatory success whilst also meeting TPP targets.\nSometimes the different types of success are inherently linked and shouldn‚Äôt be assumed as independent success probabilities that can be multiplied together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí°Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nYou can illustrate how PoS helps evaluate trade-offs: ‚ÄúFor instance, if we broaden inclusion criteria to accelerate Phase 3 recruitment (an operational win), this might impact the observed treatment effect or safety profile, and consequently, the PoS for regulatory approval.‚Äù\n\n\nBalancing diverse success objectives to design an optimal study or development program requires input from multiple stakeholders and a clear understanding of the interrelationships among key factors (ICH E8(R1)).\n\n\nSuccess at the Individual Study Level\nAt the individual study level, success is typically defined using one of the following approaches:\n\nStatistically significant difference favoring the test treatment over the reference treatment (i.e., rejection of the null hypothesis of no test treatment effect). This is the most commonly used definition of study success, particularly in Phase 3 studies.\n\nA more stringent definition of success is sometimes applied, requiring not only statistical significance but also that the point estimate of the treatment difference meets a predefined threshold for clinical relevance.\n\n‚ÄúHigh probability‚Äù of a treatment difference above target thresholds set based on clinical and/or commercial considerations. This approach is often used in early phase studies (e.g., proof of concept) to inform the decision to proceed with the development of the drug.",

    "text": "3.¬†¬†¬†Power and PoS\nMost non-statisticians are familiar with statistical power in the context of clinical trials. It‚Äôs related to PoS but differs in how it treats uncertainty‚Äîthis is effectively the difference between conditional and unconditional probability.\nStatistical Power (Conditional Probability): Statistical power is the (conditional) probability of achieving statistical significance IF the true, underlying effect of the treatment is exactly equal to a specific value assumed during the design phase (the ‚Äútarget effect size‚Äù).\nIt‚Äôs important to advise non-statisticians that, while focusing on a single target effect size may be conceptually simpler, it has limitations. Power is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the assumed effect size and if the true underlying effect size is smaller, the actual chance of success will be lower than the calculated power suggests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nExplaining Statistical Power (conditional probability): Explain, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all familiar with ‚Äòpower‚Äô from our Phase 3 sample size calculations. That power figure (e.g., 80% or 90%) is conditional ‚Äì it assumes the true treatment effect is exactly what we specified in the design (our target effect size). If that assumption is off, the actual chance of success can be different.‚Äù\n\n\nPoS (Unconditional Probability/Assurance): In contrast, PoS incorporates uncertainty into the estimate, which is a key point to communicate to non-statisticians. PoS, often referred to as average power or assurance (O‚ÄôHagan, 2005), accounts for a range of plausible true effect sizes and their associated likelihoods, based on prior knowledge or beliefs.\nThis prior knowledge about the plausible range and likelihood of the true effect size is formally captured in what is known as a prior distribution (FDA Guidance for the Use of Bayesian Statistics in Medical Device Clinical Trials, 2010). This prior distribution is typically informed by data from earlier-phase studies (e.g., Phase 2), relevant published literature, results observed with similar drugs, or expert opinion. The PoS is then calculated by essentially averaging the conditional power across possible effect sizes represented in the prior distribution, with conditional power values weighted by the probability assigned to that specific effect size by the prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nExplaining PoS (Unconditional): To explain simply, encourage non-statisticians to think of it as a kind of ‚Äúaverage power,‚Äù where the average is taken across each possible true effect size. Each effect size is weighted by a probability reflecting our belief in its likelihood, based on existing data or expert input. This results in a more realistic and robust estimate of the likelihood of success.\n\n\nIllustrative Example: PoS as Weighted Average\nTo demonstrate PoS as average power, consider this simplified example with discrete values:\n\n\n\nTrue Treatment Effect\nPrior Probability\nPower\n\n\n-1\n5%\n~0%\n\n\n0\n20%\n2.5%\n\n\n1\n25%\n28.8%\n\n\n2\n45%\n80.0%\n\n\n3\n15%\n98.8%\n\n\n\nAverage Power (PoS) = 58.3%\nInterpretation Guide:\n\nColumn 1: Different possible true treatment effects\nColumn 2: How likely we think each scenario is (based on prior evidence)\nColumn 3: How well our study would perform if that scenario were true\nBottom Row: Our overall expected success rate (PoS)\n\nKey Insight: Even though we have 80% power for our target effect of 2, our averaged PoS is lower (58.3%) because we acknowledge other plausible treatment effects.\nKey Properties of PoS:\nImpact of Prior Uncertainty: The precision of prior distribution significantly influences the PoS.\n\nUninformative Prior (e.g., very small Phase 2): When existing data is limited and uncertain (wide confidence intervals of treatment effect), the prior distribution is spread out. The resulting PoS for the next trial might be close to 50%, reflecting that the existing evidence does not strongly support either success or failure, regardless of how large the next trial is.\nInformative Prior (e.g., large, convincing Phase 2): If prior data is strong (narrow confidence intervals of treatment effect), the prior distribution is sharply focused. In this case, the PoS approaches the value of traditional power, reflecting greater confidence in the expected effect size.\n\nExample: A Phase 3 trial is planned to have 90% power to detect a treatment effect of Œ∏=2 If we had a very small Phase 2 our prior would be uninformative and flat (left figure), ¬†\nPrior results were encouraging with wide confidence interval suggesting a 20% chance the true effect is actually zero or negative (e.g.¬†p-value of 0.2). In a very large Phase 3 trial, you cannot eliminate the 20% chance that the treatment is ineffective. Therefore, the PoS for the next study is capped at 80% (1 - 0.20), regardless of sample size.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nRelating Prior Strength: ‚ÄúBecause our prior knowledge is weak, we can‚Äôt reliably predict the outcome of Phase 3. A PoS near 50% means that success and failure are equally likely.‚Äù For strong evidence: ‚ÄúThe Phase 2 results are clear and support the assumptions used in the power calculation. Therefore, the power is a reliable estimate of the PoS for Phase 3.‚Äù\n\n\nPoS Has a Ceiling (Boundedness): This is a critical difference from traditional power. Power can approach 100% if the trial is infinitely large (assuming the true effect is not zero). However, PoS is bounded ‚Äì it cannot exceed the prior probability that the treatment effect is favorable (e.g., greater than zero, or a minimally important difference).\nExample: Prior results were encouraging with wide confidence interval suggesting a 20% chance the true effect is actually zero or negative (e.g.¬†p-value of 0.2). In a very large Phase 3 trial, you cannot eliminate the 20% chance that the treatment is ineffective. Therefore, the PoS for the next study is capped at 80% (1 - 0.20), regardless of sample size.",

    "text": "4. ¬†¬†¬†Approaches to effectively communicate PoS\n\nOverlay Plots\nOverlay plots are often the most intuitive visual aids for communicating PoS. They plot two curves on the same graph:\n\nThe prior distribution, representing beliefs about the probability of each true effect size\nThe power curve, showing the probability of trial success conditional on each possible effect size\n\nThis plot visually combines prior belief with expected trial performance. If the prior peaks in a region where power is high, the PoS will be high. Conversely, if the prior suggests the effect is likely small (where power is low), the PoS will be low. To enhance interpretability, a reference line can be added to represent the traditional power calculation (e.g., 80% power at an assumed effect size of 2 in the example). This helps bridge the gap between power and PoS.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nLeveraging Visuals like Overlay Plots: Advocate for using visuals. When showing an overlay plot, explain to your audience: ‚ÄúOne curve shows what we believe about the drug‚Äôs effect based on past data (our prior distribution). The other S-shaped curve shows how likely our planned trial is to succeed at each possible effect size (conditional power). The area where these curves align most closely gives us insight into PoS: it tells us how much of our belief lies in the range where the trial is likely to succeed‚Äù. For the distribution plot, highlight that ‚Äúthe shaded area visually represents the PoS percentage ‚Äì a simple takeaway for the overall chance of success.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nSample Size Impact Visualization\nDuring study design, joint graphical representation of power and PoS across varying sample sizes can be valuable for team discussions. This visualization demonstrates how sample size adjustments affect power and PoS differently due to the ceiling effect inherent in PoS.\nIn some scenarios, increasing sample size may substantially increase power but yield only modest gain in PoS, raising questions about the justification for a larger study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nAlways show how sample size affects both power and PoS. A significant increase in power with larger sample size doesn‚Äôt automatically translate into meaningful improvement in PoS. Evaluate whether a bigger study truly adds value.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Statistics\nPoS is a single summary number (average power). However, the prior distribution implies a whole distribution of possible power values for the trial. Summarizing this distribution provides richer insights:\n\nMedian Prior Power: Answers the question: ‚ÄúBased on our prior beliefs, what‚Äôs the power level we have a 50% chance of meeting or exceeding?‚Äù. This is useful if the average PoS might be skewed by unlikely scenarios (e.g., a small chance of a very large effect boosting the average).\nOther Quantiles (e.g., 25th Percentile): Reporting a lower quantile gives a more conservative perspective, helping understand the downside risk ‚Äì the plausible lower range for the trial‚Äôs power given the uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nGoing Beyond a Single PoS Number: Explain to your audience: ‚ÄúWhile PoS gives a single ‚Äòaverage‚Äô chance of success, we can also look at the median chance (the middle-of-the-road scenario) or a more cautious estimate (like the 25th percentile). This provides a fuller picture of potential outcomes, not just the average, and helps understand the range of possibilities based on our prior beliefs.‚Äù",

    "text": "5.¬†¬†¬†Additional Topics\n\nMinimum Value (MV), Target Value (TV), and Go/No-Go/Consider Regions\nIn clinical trials, particularly in Phase 2 trials, defining clear success criteria is crucial for making informed decisions about whether to continue developing a treatment. The Minimum Value (MV) is the lowest acceptable outcome for a trial to be considered successful, while the Target Value (TV) is the desired optimal outcome.\nThese values are determined with input from various experts, including clinical, regulatory, and commercial teams, and are documented in the target product profile (TPP). Effectively communicating how likely the current trial is to meet these values is key to effective trial design.\nCommunicating MV/TV Probabilities\nDuring design, it‚Äôs important to communicate the probabilities of exceeding MV and TV. Using graphs to show how the probability of exceeding MV and TV changes with different sample sizes can make these concepts more understandable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nDiscussing Likelihood of Hitting MV/TV: Guide the team to understand it‚Äôs not just if the trial can hit the MV or TV, but how likely it is. Facilitate a discussion to set ‚Äúcomfort levels‚Äù minimum probability thresholds for achieving MV and TV (e.g., ‚ÄúWe want at least an 80% chance of hitting our Minimum Value‚Äù). Explain that these desired probabilities influence study design, particularly sample size, and depend on various factors like therapeutic area and risk appetite.\n\n\nGo/No-Go/Consider Regions\nGo/No Go/Consider Regions are used to categorize the trial outcomes based on the MV and TV. Effective communication of these regions is very important, using graphical examples to illustrate the Go, No Go, and Consider regions can help non-statisticians visualize and understand these concepts better.\nDefine Regions (Example):\n\nGo Region: Results strong enough that we‚Äôre confident (e.g.¬†80%+ probability) the drug exceeds our MV\nNo-Go Region: Results weak enough that we‚Äôre confident (e.g.¬†80%+ probability) the drug falls short of TV\nConsider Region: Results in the middle ground between MV and TV where we can‚Äôt confidently place the drug in either category‚Äîmore data or different approaches may be needed\n\nOne example of scenarios falling into Go, No Go and Consider regions can be seen in figure below (Fewer et al, 2016).\n\nGraphical Approaches: Lalonde Plots\nGo, No Go and Consider region plots (Lalonde plots or wave plots) allow the study team to explore their study design over a range of treatment effects. They are particularly helpful communicating a range of treatment effects with non-statisticians as they:\n\nProvide Visual Clarity: The plot uses clear colour-coded bands (green, yellow, red) to represent different decision outcomes. This makes it easy to understand at a glance whether a treatment is likely to be successful (Go), needs further consideration (Consider), or is unlikely to be effective (No Go).\nIntuitive to Understand: The Y-axis shows the probability, which is a familiar concept even to those without a statistical background. Seeing how these probabilities change with different treatment effects on the X-axis helps in understanding the overall effectiveness.\nFacilitates Decision Making: By categorizing outcomes into Go, Consider, and No Go, the plot provides a straightforward way to interpret the results of extensive and complex simulations over a range of treatment effects.\nEasy to communicate: These plots are excellent tools for communicating findings to stakeholders who may not have a deep understanding of statistics.\n\nPhase 2 Diabetes Example: Consider a diabetes study with change in HbA1C as the primary endpoint. The study has 32 patients per arm in the active and placebo arms and a standard deviation of 1.2%. The probability has been calculated based on 10,000 simulations per treatment effect with the MV and TV equal to -0.5% and -1% respectively.\nWhen communicating with non-statisticians, highlight the following:\n\nThe x-axis shows the difference in treatment effect between the new treatment and a placebo. Lower values means the treatment is more effective.\nThe y-axis shows the probability of the treatment effect falling into one of the three categories.\nThe coloured bands:\n\nThe green band ‚ÄúGo‚Äù represents the probability that the observed treatment effect is &lt; -1%.\nThe yellow band ‚ÄúConsider‚Äù represents the probability that the observed treatment effect is &lt;= -0.5% and &gt; -1%.\nThe red band ‚ÄúNo Go‚Äù represents the probability that the observed treatment effect &gt; -0.5%.\n\n\nLalonde plot (Fewer et al, 2016):\n\nKey Interpretations:\n\nWhen the true treatment effect relative to placebo is a 1% improvement or greater then the probability of a Go decision is at least 50%.\nWhen the true treatment effect relative to placebo is 0.5% improvement or less then the probability of a No Go decision is at least 50%.\nWhen the true treatment effect relative to placebo is an improvement between 0.5% and 1% then the probability of a Consider decision is approximately 45%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip for Statisticians:\n\n\n\nGuiding Interpretation of Lalonde Plots\nWhen presenting a Lalonde plot, walk your audience through it:\n\n‚ÄúThe bottom axis (X-axis) shows different possible true effects of our drug ‚Äì for instance, how much it might lower blood sugar compared to placebo. Remember, in this example, lower (more negative) values are better.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe side axis (Y-axis) shows the probability.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe colored bands are key. For any given true effect on the bottom, look up. The colors show the chances of our study results landing in a ‚ÄòGo‚Äô (green), ‚ÄòConsider‚Äô (yellow), or ‚ÄòNo-Go‚Äô (red) zone, based on our defined MV and TV and study design. This helps everyone see how likely each outcome is across a whole range of possibilities and discuss the implications for the study design.‚Äù\nPoint out specific interpretations from the plot, like ‚ÄúIf the true effect is X, we have a Y% chance of a ‚ÄòGo‚Äô decision‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Probability of Success in Interim Analysis\nMeasures conceptually similar to power and PoS (defined as average power) can play an important role in interim analyses by providing a quantitative estimate of the likelihood of achieving the trial‚Äôs objectives based on the available data.\n\nConditional power can be seen as an analogous measure of power in an interim analysis setting. It is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., of no test treatment effect) given the interim results and assuming a specific true effect size for the remainder of the trial.\nPredictive power or predictive probability of success (PPoS), if success is defined simply as the rejection of the null hypothesis, is an analogous measure of PoS in an interim analysis setting. It is defined as the conditional power averaged over a range of treatment effects, with weights based upon current belief about the effect size, represented by its posterior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nExplaining PoS-like Measures at Interim Looks\n\n‚ÄúConditional Power: ‚ÄòGiven what we‚Äôve seen so far, and assuming the drug‚Äôs true effect is X for the rest of the trial, what‚Äôs our chance of success?‚Äô.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPredictive PoS (PPoS): ‚ÄòThis is like updating our original PoS. Based on the early results, we revise our beliefs about the drug‚Äôs effect (this is called a posterior distribution) and recalculate an overall likelihood of trial success.‚Äô This helps the team decide whether to continue, stop, or modify the trial.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nUnblinded IA Example: Interim Analysis in a Diabetes Trial\nConsider a Phase 2 diabetes trial evaluating a new drug‚Äôs effect on HbA1c reduction. An interim analysis is planned after half the patients have completed the study. The initial PoS for achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c was estimated to be 60%.\nAfter the interim analysis, the observed effect size is larger than expected, leading to an updated PoS of 80%. This information can be communicated to non-statisticians through distribution plots showing how the posterior distribution has shifted following the interim data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipüí° Helpful Tip:\n\n\n\nVisualizing Changes in Belief Post-Interim: ‚ÄúThis type of graph is excellent for showing how an interim look at the data can change our perspective. Explain that the ‚ÄòPrior‚Äô distribution (often shown in one color, e.g., blue) was our belief about the drug‚Äôs effect before seeing the mid-trial data. The ‚ÄòPosterior‚Äô distribution (e.g., red) is our updated belief after incorporating the interim results. In an example like this, you‚Äôd point out how positive interim findings have shifted our belief towards a stronger drug effect, which in turn can boost the updated PoS (or PPoS).‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nIDMC Communication\nThe above considerations apply to an unblinded setting, where the information about treatment assignment is available. Typically, in case of interim analyses, only the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) members are unblinded. A different situation is that of a blinded observer only knowing the DMC recommendation to continue a study after an interim efficacy and/or futility analysis. If the pre-specified stopping rules are known, and assuming that the DMC adhered precisely to these rules, the PoS calculated before the trial can be updated taking into account DMC recommendation.",

The decision criterion requires being 75% confident that the mean difference between UCB and placebo &gt; 3.\nTwo panels compare the probability distribution of observed treatment effects for different sample sizes (N=30 vs.¬†N=70 per arm):\n\nThe green shaded region represents the area under the prior distribution where the study is expected to meet the decision criterion (i.e., PoS).\nThe red region represents the area where the trial is expected to fail to meet the success criterion.\n\nKey Communication Insights:\n\nWith 30 patients per arm, the probability mass is slightly wider; there is considerable chance of both success and failure across the prior distribution.\nWith 70 patients per arm, the narrower distribution leads to slightly more precise predications‚Äîsuccess is more likely if the compound truly works, but also less likely if it doesn‚Äôt.\nThis visualization clearly shows how the PoS is a function of both prior and sample size‚Äîand how increasing N reduces ambiguity but doesn‚Äôt always increase PoS\n\nSuch plots help decision-makers understand that increasing sample size does not always increase the PoS‚Äîespecially when the prior includes a realistic chance of failure. It also underlines the importance of the prior, and how decision criteria (e.g., ‚Äú75% sure &gt; 3‚Äù) interact with study design and assumptions.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix C: Addressing Common Questions and Misconceptions¬†\nUnderstanding frequent misunderstandings allows statisticians to proactively address them during communications.\n1.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúPoS and Power are the same thing‚Äù\nThe Issue: Non-statisticians often assume that if a study is designed with 80% power, the PoS is also 80%.\nWhy It Occurs: Both are expressed as percentages and relate to study success probability.\nHow to Address: ‚ÄúPower and PoS both relate to our chances of success, but they differ in an important way. Power asks: ‚ÄòIf the true effect is exactly what we assumed in our design, what‚Äôs our chance of success?‚Äô PoS asks: ‚ÄòConsidering all the different effects the drug might actually have‚Äîbased on our current knowledge‚Äîwhat‚Äôs our realistic chance of success?‚Äô\nVisual Aid: Show a simple table comparing power at different assumed effect sizes with the weighted average (PoS).\n2.¬†¬†¬† Misconception 2: ‚ÄúLow PoS means the drug doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù\n3.¬†¬†¬† Misconception 3: ‚ÄúBigger trials always increase PoS‚Äù\n4. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt our PoS higher if we designed the study with 80% power?‚Äú\n5.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúCan we increase the PoS by changing the study design?‚Äù\n6.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúWhat if the PoS is wrong?‚Äù\n7.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúHow do we explain this PoS to our board/investors?‚Äù\n8.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúThis PoS seems too conservative/optimistic compared to my clinical intuition‚Äù\n9.¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúWhy did PoS change from our last calculation?‚Äù\n\n\nAppendix D: References\n\nCore References\n\nFrewer, P., Mitchell, P., Watkins, C., Matcham, J.
